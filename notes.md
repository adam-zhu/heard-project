- started off by reading the product specs and modelling out the data, then created a REST API esque set of structured interactions and started building frontend against that
  - currently data is just persisted to localStorage and there is no separate API/db entity, just a client bundle
- login features are faked out
- factored everything primarily according to getting as many features built as quickly as possible
  - if I had more time I'd've done a better job with creating constructs to manage the user and account contexts and to manage data in a more efficient manner
- did budget timeframes as just interval from whenever budget was made rather than an interval that'd lock to atomic weeks/months
- left to do:
  - expense approval
  - edit expense, edit budget
  - features regarding parents managing children's budgets
  - real login
  - real data persistence
  - styling
